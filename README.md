## Overview
This repository contains all the relevant materials for the SILAR rover's mission of investigating water ice abundance and isotopic variations in lunar regolith, particularly within and around Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) near the lunar south pole(Shackleton Crater, primary investigation site). This project is part of the NASA L’SPACE Mission Concept Academy (MCA) Summer 2024 Program.

The NASA L'Space Team SILAR (Space Ice and Lunar Analysis Reconnaissance) project is an innovative mission concept designed to explore and analyze the presence of water ice and isotopic variations within the lunar regolith, with a focus on the Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) near the lunar south pole. Targeting Shackleton Crater, the mission aims to gather critical data on the abundance and depth of water ice deposits, as well as isotopic signatures from ancient solar and cosmic ray activity. This information is vital for advancing scientific understanding of the Moon’s geologic history and supports future in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) technologies for sustainable lunar exploration.
